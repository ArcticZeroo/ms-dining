MSDining is a frontend for the buy-ondemand websites that Microsoft cafes use. 

Other companies like Disney also use the same system, so this may work for you if you reconfigure the server config.

## Why MSDining over buy-ondemand?

- Significantly faster loading time
  - It can take multiple minutes to view the entire menu for a cafe on buy-ondemand, but it takes less than a second to 
  load everything on MSDining, and only a few seconds to scroll to what you're interested in.
- Search
- Cafe groups
  - buy-ondemand requires you to go to separate websites for each cafe
- Hopefully lower bandwidth usage
  - Thumbnails especially use a ton of bandwidth on the official website. One thumbnail for a coffee from Dote can be 
  9MB on the official site, or only 40KB on MSDining.
